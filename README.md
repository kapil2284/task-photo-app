# Few points about the assignment:

I have used NPM version 9.6.7, we need to clone the repo, run npm install and npm start

Validations in the user form are not added yet

User form is responsive

Photo album is responsive as well, but because photo albums are displayed in original size. rendering overflows the size of small screens

There can be lot of improvement done to display just thumbnails in the list and load the photo widget on hover

wrote one sample test case to submit form using react testing library, its written in App.test.js

I have used controlled inputs to create the form and on submitting data is sent to server using POST request with JSON body
